cabbit
=============

[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/badge/cabbit-0.1.0-orange.svg)](https://github.com/delimobil/cabbit)

A [cabbit] is a fictional hybrid between a cat and a rabbit.

The main goal of the library is to wrap rabbit-client with cats-effect & fs2.
The wrapper is intended to be thin and resemble the client.
`fs2` & `amqp-client` are the only dependencies.

## Usage

cabbit is cross built for `scala "2.12.15" | "2.13.6" | "3.0.2"` & `ce2 | ce3`.
Thus, you can choose from these artifacts:

|               | `ce 3.2.9`(through `fs2 3.1.3`) | `ce 2.5.1` (through `fs2 2.5.9`) |
|      ---      | --- | --- |
| scala 2.12.15 | cabbit_2.12 | cabbit_ce2_2.12 |
| scala 2.13.6  | cabbit_2.13 | cabbit_ce2_2.13 |
| scala 3.0.2   | cabbit_3    | cabbit_ce2_3    |


For ce3 versions add this instruction to your build.sbt:
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "ru.delimobil" %% "cabbit" % "0.1.0"
```
For ce2 versions replace `cabbit` with `cabbit_ce2`.
To use circe encoders add this artifact to your build.sbt:
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "ru.delimobil" %% "cabbit-circe" % "0.1.0"
```

## Teaser
This is how you can publish an arbitrary class to RabbitMQ:

```scala
    import io.circe.generic.auto._
    import ru.delimobil.cabbit.encoder.json.jsonUtf8

    case class Message(from: String, msg: String)    
    
    val node = CabbitNodeConfig(host, port)
    val config = CabbitConfig(NonEmptyList.one(node), "/")
    val exchange = ExchangeName.default
    val rk = RoutingKey("teaser-example-queue")
    val msg = Message("TeaserPublishApp", "hello from cabbit")
    ConnectionFactoryProvider
      .provide[IO](config, sslContext = None)
      .newConnection(config.addresses)
      .flatMap(_.createChannelPublisher)
      .use(_.basicPublish(exchange, rk, msg))
```
