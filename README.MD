cabbit
=============

[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/badge/cabbit-0.0.13-orange.svg)](https://github.com/delimobil/cabbit)

A [cabbit] is a fictional hybrid between a cat and a rabbit.

The main goal of the library is to wrap rabbit-client with cats-effects & fs2. The wrapper is intended to be thin and resemble the client. However,
- It's widely spread to separate producer, declarator and publisher, thus it is mentioned in algebra.
- Client's channel is not thread safe, hence a dedicated fixed thread pool is assigned to every channel.
